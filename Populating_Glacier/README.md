# Populating Glaciers
> _In 157, Kussad became the Jarl of The Helmed Confederacies._

## Features

* __Scandinavian-inspired human civilization__: Near the poles are the homes of the Jarls, humans courageous enough to face everlasting winters, dig through glaciers and brave the perils of these lands. Similar to vanilla humans, but limited to cold biomes and with different organization (religion and nobility).
* __Mammoths__: These hairy giants will roam the frozen parts of the world. They can be sheared and can prove to be very good pets.
