# Dwarf fortress modding

## Content

This repository presents the different mods for Dwarf Fortress I'm working on. All of the mods are designed to work together and may be played so. Further information on each of them can be found in their own folder. There are at the moment 3 different mods:
* Evil Dwarves: Twisted reflection of the vanilla dwarf, this mod offers a new __playable civilization__ of tiny and evil creatures ruling the underworld with educated trolls and a horde of strange molluscs such as the __milky crabs__ or the __hairy slugs__.

* Norse: This quite simple mod is meant to populate the poles by adding a __new human civilization__, __mammoths__ and (planned) other creatures.

* Savage Dwarves: Whether they are some kind of cousin of the vanilla dwarf or the offspring of mining parties that got lost in the caves, these __blind, pale and skinny creatures__ dwell the underground of the earth.

## Graphics

For the time being only Spacefox is supported, but other graphics may be integrated in the future. Starting with Phoebus (_maybe_).
