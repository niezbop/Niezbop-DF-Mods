# Evil dwarves
> _A short, sturdy creature fond of volcanos and fortresses._

## Features

* __New playable civilization__: the Evil Dwarves, a doomed version of the vanilla dwarf. While similar to them, one cannot mistake one for the other; whether it be their blueish beards and skin, their horns or even their grim looks, evil dwarves are quite distinct from their cousins. Striken by a mysterious curse, every other female is unable to bear any children, clouding the future of this race. Tormented by this prospect, the question of mortality haunts them and drove a fair share to seek blessings from their gods.
* __Evil pets to bring along__: hordes of strange giant molluscs follow the Evil Dwarves, from wooly slugs to milk-bearing crabs.
* __Troll teaching__: trolls that will come along the evil dwarves may be taught how to speak, and will become full citizen of your fortresses.
